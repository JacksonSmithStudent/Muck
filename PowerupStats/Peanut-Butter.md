The peanut butter effect is a linear multiplier to the stamina drain. With 0 peanut butter your stamina drain has a base value of 1, and each peanut butter adds 0.15 to that value. This value is then multiplied by the adrenaline boost, if active. When stamina is drained, it is first divided by this value. So with 0 peanut butter, it divides by 1 and does nothing. With 20 peanut butter, this multiplier is increased by 3, so stamina drain is divided by 4, effectively letting you run/jump for 4x as long.  There is no limit to this powerup, other than the bounds of 32-bit integers.
