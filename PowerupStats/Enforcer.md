This powerup has not been implemented in the game yet. It does have a calculation function, which is hardcoded to just return 1 at the moment. That function takes a parameter of the player's velocity at the time an arrow was fired. That parameter is just -1 for melee weapons, for now. The enforcer multiplier is applied directly to the final damage. I don't know if it's only gonna affect arrows, or if the melee part is just unimplemented for now.
