The dumbbell effect adds to your strength multiplier. The strength has a base value of 1, and the [Berserk](#Berserk) and this effect will add to that value. Dumbbell is not exponential, it is simply the amount of dumbbells you have times 0.1 (so 10 dumbbells is +1 strength = 2x base without berserk, and 100 dumbbells is +10 strength = 11x base without berserk)
