The checkered shirt has a cumulative distribution function with a scale speed of 0.3 and a max value of 4. This value plus 1, and also plus 1.75 if you're playing in versus mode, is a multiplier for the amount of damage you deal to any resources.

Here's the chart of how much additional damage you'll deal with checkered shirts (doesn't work with striped ones):

###### If you want a graph for versus mode, click the image and enable the blue line in the sidebar. It's the same curve though, just higher up, so you can also mentally add 1.75 to the Y axis on the graph above.

And here are the first couple values if you want those numbers:

cum: `${n(5, 1 + calc(0.3, 4), 2)}x resource damage (${n(6.75, 2.75 + calc(0.3, 4))}x in versus})`
