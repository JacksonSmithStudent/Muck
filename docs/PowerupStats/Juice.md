Juice has a cumulative distribution function with a scale speed of 0.3 and a max value of 1. Whenever you hit an enemy with a weakness that matches one of your weapons' attack types, you will get "juiced up" which means multiplying your attack speed by the juice value plus 1. Honestly, this powerup is way worse than i expected. It's blue even! It's like OJ except not active all the time, it only is *slightly* more attack speed for less powerup, but they cap out at the same value!

cum: `${n(2, 1 + calc(0.3, 1))}x attack speed when juiced up`
