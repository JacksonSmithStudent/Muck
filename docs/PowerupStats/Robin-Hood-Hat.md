This powerup has not been implemented yet. The code does not have the actual stats of it in the current version of the game, it's hard-coded to return 1. However, its value *does* get used to calculate some other values.

- The time it takes to charge your bow is always divided by the robin value (i.e. 2x robin = half as long to charge the bow).
- The force that is added to an arrow when you shoot it is always multiplied by the robin value
- The damage that an arrow will deal when you fire it is always multiplied by the robin value
