Every time you get one of Jannik's Frogs, you gain 1 additonal jump. However many frogs you have (plus one, because you can jump even without any frogs) is how many times you can jump before hitting the ground. One frog gives you double jump, two frogs gives you triple jump, and there is no cap on the frogs other than the bounds of 32-bit integers.
